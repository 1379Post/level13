# Contributing to Level 13

## General

Level 13 is a personal side project. Bug reports and suggestions are very welcome, but updates happen sporadically and it might take a while for your contributions to be reviewed.

## Issues

You can use issues to submit bug reports or to suggest new features or enhancements to existing features.

* Only submit one bug or feature request per issue
* Before submitting a new issue/suggestion, check that it hasn't already been posted
* For bugs, write down what happened and what you expected to happen
* Mention the version number you were playing (you can find it in the bottom left of the page)

## Pull requests

If you want to contribute a small bug-fix then by all means do so. Please refrain from sending pull requests containing bigger refactoring or new behaviour.
